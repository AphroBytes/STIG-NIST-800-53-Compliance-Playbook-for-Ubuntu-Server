## Making Contributions

### Contributions Types

You can contribute by:
- **Implementing Features**: Enhancing the Ansible playbooks or roles by adding new functionalities.
- **Fixing Bugs**: Resolving issues identified in the current Ansible scripts.
- **Improving Documentation**: Clarifying existing documentation or adding new sections for better understanding.
- **Testing Roles**: Running and testing playbooks to ensure the compliance of STIGs, SRGs, or NIST 800-53 practices.

### Guidelines for Contributions

- Please ensure your code is written in Ansible best practices.
- Ensure to document any new features or modifications in the README or relevant documentation.
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, following a format like:

  ```
  [Type]: Brief description of changes
  ```

  where **Type** can be one of the following:
